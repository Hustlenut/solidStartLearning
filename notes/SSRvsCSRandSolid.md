09\.10.2023, 11:35 Solid.js Rendering Issue Troubleshoot

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR) vs. Client-Side Rendering (CSR):**

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**:

The server generates the full HTML for a page on each request.

The server sends the fully rendered page to the client.

The benefit is that the user can start viewing the page while the JavaScript bundles are still loading.

SEO friendly because web crawlers can see a fully rendered page.

**Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**:

JavaScript running on the client produces HTML content.

The browser initially loads a "barebones" HTML page.

Once JavaScript is loaded and executed, it populates the page with content. Useful for web apps where content changes dynamically and frequently.

**Hybrid Rendering:**

A hybrid approach often leverages the strengths of both SSR and CSR. Initial page load can come fully rendered from the server (SSR), then subsequent navigation and dynamic content loading happens on the client side (CSR).

**How it Works in Solid:**

**entry-server.tsx**: Handles the server-side logic. When a request comes in, this script will generate the necessary HTML for the page and send it to the client. It's often responsible for things like data-fetching for that initial load.

**entry-client.tsx**: Handles the client-side logic. After the initial page (which was rendered by the server) is loaded, this script takes over and handles dynamic behaviors, interactivity, and subsequent page navigations.

**Do I need two servers?**

No, you don't need two separate servers. Typically, a single server handles both the initial SSR and serves the static assets (JavaScript, CSS, etc.) for CSR.

When a request comes in:

The server checks if it's an initial page load request. If it is, it serves the SSR-rendered page.

For all subsequent interactions, the client-side scripts (served from the same server or a CDN) take over, and the app behaves like a Single Page Application (SPA).

**Making your App Partially SSR and CSR:**

For what you've described (serving the initial layout via SSR and deferring JavaScript to client-side):

Use SSR to render the initial layout. Your **entry-server.tsx** will handle this. Defer loading non-essential JavaScript until after the initial render, so the user sees the page faster. This is more of a performance optimization pattern. Tools like **React.lazy()** in React (and similar concepts in other frameworks) allow you to split your code into chunks and load them only when needed.

All subsequent dynamic behaviors and interactions will be handled by CSR. Your **entry-client.tsx** will manage this.

**Deployment:**

For deployment:

Deploy your server code (which includes SSR logic). This will handle incoming requests and serve the initial rendered page.

The same server, or a Content Delivery Network (CDN), will serve static assets like JavaScript, CSS, and images. These assets are utilized for the CSR portion of your app.

In summary, SSR and CSR can be thought of as two complementary techniques. SSR provides fast initial page loads and is SEO-friendly, while CSR provides the rich interactivity of web apps. Using them in a hybrid approach allows developers to leverage the strengths of both. Solid, like many modern frontend frameworks, provides tools and patterns to enable this hybrid approach effectively.
