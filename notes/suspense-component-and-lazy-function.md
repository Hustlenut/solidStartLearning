09\.10.2023, 11:28 Solid.js Rendering Issue Troubleshoot

In Solid and many modern JavaScript frameworks, **Suspense**, **lazy()**, and asynchronous operations are concepts and tools that help optimize the user experience by managing how components are loaded and rendered, particularly in scenarios where some parts of the app are not immediately available. Let's break each of them down:

**lazy()**:

The **lazy()** function allows you to load a component lazily, which means the component will be loaded (usually via a network request) only when it is actually required to be rendered.

In practice, you might use **lazy()** for components that are part of routes not immediately visited by the user, or for heavier components that you don't want to be part of the initial JavaScript bundle.

It essentially helps in code splitting: breaking up your app into smaller chunks that can be loaded on-demand.

Example:

tsx ![ref1] Copy code

const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

**Suspense**:

The **Suspense** component provides a fallback UI for any component tree inside of it until all components inside are fully loaded. This can be used with **lazy()** to display loading spinners or other fallback content until the lazy-loaded component is available.

In Solid, **Suspense** can also be used with asynchronous operations to wait for data fetching or any other async tasks.

Example:

tsx ![ref1] Copy code

<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}> <LazyComponent /> </Suspense> **Asynchronous Operations (like async functions)**:

Asynchronous operations, typically using the **async** and **await** keywords in JavaScript, are used to perform tasks in a non-blocking way. For example, fetching data from an API or reading from a database.

Solid's **Suspense** is not just limited to lazy-loading components; it can also be used in conjunction with data-fetching operations to provide a seamless experience for waiting on data.

In summary:

**lazy()** helps you load components as they are needed, rather than all at once.

**Suspense** provides a way to show fallback content while components or data are being loaded.

**Asynchronous operations** are the actual tasks, like data fetching, that might take time to complete.

When used together, these tools allow you to build efficient, seamless, and user-friendly web applications that load quickly and adapt as necessary while waiting for content or data.
