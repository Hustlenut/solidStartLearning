# Issues stumbled upon

- Fileroutes component had issues running with the development server on Chrome prior to version 117.0.5938.150.

# Other dependencies

- There exists notes and tutorial files in PDF and picture formats.
- Install json-server: "npm install -g json-server". Then start the server: "json-server --watch db.json --port 5000". 

# SolidStart

Everything you need to build a Solid project, powered by [`solid-start`](https://start.solidjs.com);

## Creating a project

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm init solid@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm init solid@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Solid apps are built with _adapters_, which optimise your project for deployment to different environments.

By default, `npm run build` will generate a Node app that you can run with `npm start`. To use a different adapter, add it to the `devDependencies` in `package.json` and specify in your `vite.config.js`.
